# 🛣️ Geo-linked Road Project Tracker

A digital infrastructure initiative by **CMC Ambala** under the C4GT program to bring transparency and efficiency to road project tracking. This system enables ward-wise project monitoring through geo-tagged entries, checklists, dashboards, and role-based workflows.

## 🔭 Project Description

Currently in Ambala, there is no end-to-end tracking system once road tenders are released. This results in:

* Lack of visibility into project progress
* High frequency of rework
* Poor maintenance and accountability

This project introduces a modern, digital alternative:

* **Geo-linked road registry** with ward mapping
* **Checklist-based tracking** for key development stages
* **Photo uploads** to verify milestone completion
* **Dashboards** for cost and status summaries

## 🎯 Objectives

* Track the **full lifecycle of road projects**
* Ensure **real-time progress monitoring**
* Maintain **audit trails and visual logs**
* Promote **transparency in vendor assignments**

## 🧩 Core Features

* Geo-tagging for each road/tender
* Admin dashboard to create and assign tenders
* Vendor dashboard to apply and submit updates
* Milestone checklist interface
* Photo uploads per milestone for verification
* Ward-wise dashboard with cost/progress analytics

## 🏢 Organization

* **Name**: CMC Ambala
* **Domain**: Infrastructure Governance / Civic Analytics
* **Mentors**: TBD under C4GT

## 📦 Deliverables

* A live registry of road projects
* Admin and vendor dashboards
* Geo-tagged progress visualizations
* Transparent vendor assignment workflow
